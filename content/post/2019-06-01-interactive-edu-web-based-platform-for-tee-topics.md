## Abstract

The paper represents web-based educational platform, which delivers resources and theoretical electrical engineering related topics.
The platform allows easily access by everyone because of its web-based nature.
The system is based on top of the free open source software which makes its development efficient and time reduced significantly.
The purpose of this interactive educational web-based platform is to provide a variety of significant, quality, and understandable content.
Architecture of the platform is scalable and extendable.
The article describes theoretical underpinnings, features, architecture, implementation of particular platform, and the application results.

## Conclusion

The Interactive education web-based platform for theoretical electrical engineering related topics and resources is created.
The platform provides easily use by the end clients and the contributors (authors) of the content.
The required recourses for deploying, hosting and keeping live the system are free.
The system is responsive and accessible by most used devices on the following URL [https://tee.ayanev.eu](https://tee.ayanev.eu)
