A inverter that synthesizes three-phase quasi-sinusoidal voltage supply to the active load through method of controlled pulses with pulse-width modulation is investigated. The linear dependence of active power in load and regulation angle, the first harmonic amplitude of load voltage and regulation angle, respectively is achieved. Simulations of the converter to achieve a quasi-sinusoidal voltage in the converter output are carried out. SIMULINK model of the three-phase converter for industrial purpose with reduced distortion is composed. The obtained quasi-sinusoidal voltage is not ideal one, but leads to a significant reduction of harmonics in the load of the converter. This ensures lower level of electromagnetic interference and improves electromagnetic compatibility.
