The platform aim to provide a variety of Theoretical electrical engineering related topics.

I'm a PhD student in Theoretical Electrical Engineering at [Technical University of Sofia](https://tu-sofia.bg/). For me, gaining knowledge is way of life and one of my biggest passion is programming. I also love traveling, discovering new places, handling challenges, solving problems and creating unique stuff. All these things make me feel alive and I cannot imagine my world without doing them. And, as you can probably see, I'm also a passionate copywriter! Hope you enjoy the journey as you surf through.
